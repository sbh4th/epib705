## Unmeasured Confounding

## Introduction

How do misclassification, selection bias, and unmeasured confounding create bias in parameter estimation?

::: incremental
> By assuming that all errors are random and that any modeling assumptions (such as homogeneity) are correct, all uncertainty about the effect of errors on estimates is subsumed within conventional standard deviations for the estimates (standard errors), such as those given in earlier chapters (which assume no measurement error), and any discrepancy between an observed association and the target effect may be attributed to chance alone - (RGL, p.346)

-   Bias analysis is an attempt to "safeguard against failure to attribute effects to exposure rather than systematic error"

## Example



> Several potential limitations of the present investigation must be considered in drawing conclusions from the results. In particular, AMD was ascertained only in one eye, resulting in a possible underestimation of AMD cases; however, studies have shown that AMD development is typically symmetric. Further, AMD was identified using nonmydriatic fundus photography without dilating the pupils, which may have led to potential misclassification of cases. In estimating milk and fish intake, the food frequency questionnaire used in this study was not validated and the measurement error was unknown. The serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D values would reflect sun exposure and food intake over recent weeks, rather than years, which would have enhanced random measurement error. Therefore, **associations reported are likely to be biased toward the null.**[^*]

## Record level implementation

-   Step 1: Identify the Source of Bias
-   Step 2: Select the Bias Parameters
-   Step 3: Assign Probability Distributions to Each Bias Parameter
-   Step 4: Use Simple Bias Analysis Methods to Incorporate Uncertainty in the Bias Parameters and Random Error
    -   Step 4a: Randomly Sample from the Bias Parameter Distributions
    -   Step 4b: Use Simple Bias Analysis Methods and Incorporate Uncertainty and Conventional Random Error
    -   Step 4c: Sample the Bias-Adjusted Effect Estimate
-   Step 5: Save the Bias-Adjusted Estimate and Repeat Steps 4a--c

## Unmeasured Confounding

Example of Sensitivity Analysis for Unmeasured Confounding

-   Crude OR: $OR_{DX+}=(45\times945)/(94\times257)=1.76$

| Disease Status | X=1 | X=0  | Total |
|----------------|-----|------|-------|
| Cases (D=1)    | 45  | 94   | 139   |
| Controls (D=0) | 257 | 945  | 1202  |
| Total          | 302 | 1039 | 1341  |

-   We think this is confounded by smoking $(Z)$, but we did not measure it.

-   How can we quantify the potential effect of failing to adjust for $Z$?

-   To adjust for smoking we need stratum-specific ORs.

-   We can write the exposure-disease OR \textbf{within strata} of $Z$ $\left(OR_{DXZ}\right)$ as:

$OR_{DX_{Z=1}}=\dfrac{A_{11}B_{01}}{A_{01}B_{11}}$

$OR_{DX_{Z=0}}=\dfrac{\left(A_{1+}-A_{11}\right)\left(B_{0+}-B_{01}\right)}{\left(A_{0+}-A_{01}\right)\left(B_{1+}-B_{11}\right)}$

We already know the marginal totals, so only 4 quantities to estimate.

- These values may be generated by specifying values for the prevalence of smoking in each exposure group and the association between smoking and disease.

- The (unknown) smoking prevalence in exposure strata are:  

    $P_{Z1}=N_{11}/N_{1+}$ and $P_{Z0}=N_{01}/N_{0+}$ 
    
## Ex
```{r tab}
z1 <- rep(1,9)
x1 <- rep(seq(1:3),3)
d1 <- rep(seq(1:3), each=3)
c1 <- c("A11", "A01", "M11",
        "B11", "B01", "M01",
        "N11", "N01", "N+1")
df <- data.frame(z1, x1, d1, c1)
df1 <- df %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = x1, values_from = c1)
```
